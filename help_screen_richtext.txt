The Next button stops play on the current puzzle picture and displays the next puzzle picture. Patterns does not allow you to go back to a puzzle picture you have skipped.

The goal of the game is to find all the patterns listed beneath the puzzle picture. When you find the pattern in the puzzle picture, then position the mouse cursor over the pattern in the puzzle picture and click it with the left mouse button. If this is a correct pattern, then Patterns will draw a blue box around the pattern in the puzzle picture. When you have found all the patterns, then Patterns will display a popup showing how much time it took you to solve the puzzle and whether you want to continue or quit.
